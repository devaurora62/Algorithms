PSEUDOCODE

(Recurrence relation for the length array)
      | 1,                                              if A[i]>A[j], j = i+1, i+2, ..., n
L[i] =| 1 + max(A[j], j=i+1, i+2, ..., n, A[j]>=A[i]),  otherwise  

(To find a subsequence of maximal length we use an ind[] array that stores the index of each maximum value)
